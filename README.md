# cg-toolkit


This repository is meant to be a big library of what you need when doing contests and multi games on Codingame.

## Code base
The code-base part is a methods and classes library by language and type of games they apply to.
For cpp/c, note that you cannot use compile units due to the restrictions of the codingame platform. With this in mind, code wisely (in short words: headers library only)

## Tools
The tool part is a set of tools mostly for local code.
- **Merge tool** : needs to be created by language, but in essence, it merges all the files you needed to develop your solution in a single file to feed the codingame platform.
